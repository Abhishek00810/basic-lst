🌊 Liquid Staking Token (LST) on Solana
This project implements a Liquid Staking Token (LST) system on the Solana blockchain without relying on smart contracts. It uses TypeScript and Solana libraries to provide a simple, efficient, and decentralized solution for staking and liquidity.

🛠️ Features
Liquid Staking: Stake SOL and receive liquid tokens representing your stake.
No Smart Contracts: Achieved using Solana’s existing libraries for better performance and simplicity.
Enhanced Liquidity: Unlock the value of staked assets for further use in DeFi ecosystems.
TypeScript-Powered: Ensures type safety, maintainable code, and developer-friendly experience.
🚀 How It Works
Stake SOL: Users deposit SOL to participate in staking.
Mint LST: Liquid Staking Tokens are minted proportionally to the staked amount.
Redeem SOL: Users can redeem their SOL using LST when needed.
🏗️ Technology Stack
Solana Web3.js: To interact with the Solana blockchain.
TypeScript: For building a clean and robust codebase.
